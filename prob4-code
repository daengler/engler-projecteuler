;; hardest part was figuring out the correct order to descend the pairs
;; I drew out a triangle of descending values starting from 4,4 to help
;;
;; 4,4
;; 4,3  3,3
;; 4,2  3,2  2,2
;; 4,1  3,1  2,1  1,1

;; and in the interest of full disclosure that failed!
;; If I had expanded my triangle out to 5,5 I would have realized that method doesn't work.
;; I don't think there's a way to guarantee I can get the results in descending order

;;
;; Finally, with some research on how to do for loops I figured out the following solution which multiplies ALL
;; combinations of three digit numbers, filters out the palindromes, and then takes the max value.  That did it.
