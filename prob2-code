Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

BRUTE FORCE...

Generate fibonacci sequence?

0 1 2 3 5 8 ...

fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 2, etc.
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)


Stop generating fibonacci values when we reach 4 million.  Sum up the evens on the way.

Var sumofevenvalues
Var currentvalue = 1
Var previousvalue = 0
While (currentvalue < 4000000) {
If (currentvalue is even) {
Sumofevenvalues += currentvalue
}
Newvalue = currentvalue + previousvalue
Previousvalue = currentvalue
Currentvalue = newvalue
}

Do this in clojure… recursion again is my method

=================

(defn prob2 [prev-val, curr-val, even-sum stop-val]
(if (>= curr-val stop-val)
even-sum
(if (= 0 (mod curr-val 2))
(prob2 curr-val (+ curr-val  prev-val) (+ even-sum curr-val) stop-val )
(prob2 curr-val (+ curr-val prev-val) even-sum  stop-val) )
)
)

=================


Call this as so:
(prob2 0 1 0 4000000)
4613732



Thoughts after reading discussion.
Need to think more about the math before jumping in brute force.
Also… recursion is a fine tool, but not always appropriate.  I blame this on learning Lisp in a comparative programming language course years ago.
